## Position and Grid

After last weeks assessment, I spent some additional time researching grid, flex and positioning as I had real trouble with last weeks requirement. My main resource was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=203s&pp=ygUIY3NzIGdyaWQ%3D. I hope I managed a responsive layout this week and used grid as attended. I still noticed some design flaws, but hoping to remedy them until the assignment is due.

## Planning

The last two assignments I started without having a real plan. I went straight in with JavaScript, didn't have a clear picutre of how the page should be structured and just hoped for the best. This time I followed a clear structure. I first set out the HTML and created the CSS on top of it. I had to do some small tweaks on the HTML but overall I'm happy with this approach. Once these two are completed, I can fully focus on JS and later add CSS where required rather than dip in and out and confuse myself in the proces.
