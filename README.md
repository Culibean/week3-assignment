# week3-assignment

A cookie clicker game 🍪

## Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

## Required

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

- I managed to fetch data from the provided API and by clicking them updated the cookie count.
- I have tried to keep functions contained and have everything wrapped it one for the API and shop
- I added Event Listeners so when the user clicks on buttons, it creates a reaction.
- I have made use of local storage and the user is able to retrieve their latest game status when reloading
- I added an interval so the cookie count goes up by the cps number once an upgrade has been purchased

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- Ibelieve I have achieved everything as required

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

## Position and Grid

After last weeks assessment, I spent some additional time researching grid, flex and positioning as I had real trouble with last weeks requirements. My main resource was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=203s&pp=ygUIY3NzIGdyaWQ%3D. I hope I managed a responsive layout this week and used grid as intended. I still noticed some design flaws, but hoping to remedy them until the assignment is due.

## Planning

The last two assignments I started without having a real plan. I went straight in with JavaScript, didn't have a clear picutre of how the page should be structured and just hoped for the best. This time I followed a clear structure. I first set out the HTML and created the CSS on top of it. I had to do some small tweaks on the HTML but overall I'm happy with this approach. Once these two are completed, I can fully focus on JS and later add CSS where required rather than dip in and out and confuse myself in the proces.

## JS Functions

I still sometimes struggle with JS functions, more so with naming conventions, when to use parameters etc. I spent some time in the past week completing some additional classes on codeacademy and this has helped. I tend to fit a lot into one function as I am otherwise overwhelmed. This has helped me with this assignment, but I'm unsure if this is correct.

It also helped that I was able to reuse a lof my functions from either this week or reuse them within the code, for example the local storage code. Again, it seems to work when testing it but not sure if this is good practice.

## Overall

I feel much more confident by the end of this week than I did last week. There is still a lot to catch up on, specifically around JS. I still sometimes struggle with the amount of different ways the same thing can be achieved. I want to get a better understanding on API's and once they are on the page, how to style them.

I also need to learn to ask for help more. I have been searching through google, forums and videos a lot but this slows me down.
